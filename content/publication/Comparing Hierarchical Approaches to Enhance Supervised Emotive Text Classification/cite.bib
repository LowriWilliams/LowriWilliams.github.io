ABSTRACT = {The performance of emotive text classification using affective hierarchical schemes (e.g., WordNet-Affect) is often evaluated using the same traditional measures used to evaluate the performance of when a finite set of isolated classes are used. However, applying such measures means the full characteristics and structure of the emotive hierarchical scheme are not considered. Thus, the overall performance of emotive text classification using emotion hierarchical schemes is often inaccurately reported and may lead to ineffective information retrieval and decision making. This paper provides a comparative investigation into how methods used in hierarchical classification problems in other domains, which extend traditional evaluation metrics to consider the characteristics of the hierarchical classification scheme, can be applied and subsequently improve the classification of emotive texts. This study investigates the classification performance of three widely used classifiers, Naive Bayes, J48 Decision Tree, and SVM, following the application of the aforementioned methods. The results demonstrated that all the methods improved the emotion classification. However, the most notable improvement was recorded when a depth-based method was applied to both the testing and validation data, where the precision, recall, and F1-score were significantly improved by around 70 percentage points for each classifier.},
