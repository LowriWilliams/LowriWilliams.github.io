abstract: Digital Security by Design (DSbD) is an initiative supported by the UK government aimed at transforming digital technology to deliver necessary digital resilience and prosperity across the UK. As emerging challenges in the field of digital security evolve, it becomes essential to explore how entities involved in DSbD interact and change over time. Understanding these dynamic relationships can provide crucial insights for the development and improvement of security practices. This paper presents a data-driven analysis of the evolving landscape of DSbD from 2019 to 2024, gathering insights from textual documents referencing DSbD. Using a combination of text mining techniques and network analysis, a large corpus of textual documents was examined to identify key entities, including organisations, individuals, and the relationships between them. A network was then visualised to analyse the structural connections between these entities, revealing how key concepts and actors have evolved. The results and discussion demonstrate that the network analysis offers a unique advantage in tracking and visualising these evolving relationships, providing insights into shifts in focus, emerging trends, and changes in technological adoption over time. For example, a notable finding from the analysis is the substantial increase in node relationships associated with Artificial Intelligence (AI). We hypothesise that this surge reflects the growing integration of AI into digital security strategies, driven by the need for more adaptive and autonomous solutions to tackle evolving cyber threats, as well as the rapid introduction of new AI tools to the market and their swift adoption across various industries. By mapping such connections, such results are useful, helping practitioners and researchers recognise new security demands and adjust strategies to better respond to the evolving landscape of DSbD.
