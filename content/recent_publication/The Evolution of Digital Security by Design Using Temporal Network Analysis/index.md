abstract: This paper presents a data-driven analysis of the evolving landscape of DSbD from 2019 to 2024, gathering insights from textual documents referencing DSbD. Using a combination of text mining techniques and network analysis, a large corpus of textual documents was examined to identify key entities, including organisations, individuals, and the relationships between them.
