I am a Lecturer at the [School of Computer Science and Informatics](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/computer-science/) at [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/). My work focuses on the development of novel approaches to automated cyber defence. Currently, my interest is on how to apply text mining and machine learning techniques in defence methodologies.
